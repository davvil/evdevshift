This program allows to map events from one evdev device to newly created
virtual one. Buttons can be conditionaly remapped, and axes can be mapped
to buttons (usefull to map hats to buttons).

Prerequisities:
Expecting bison and flex are installed.
To allow easier testing, it is good idea to install the evtest program.
To create a virtual device, you need to be able to write to /dev/uinput;
  prefered method is to use ACLs to achieve that.
  E.g. sudo setfacl -m user:simmer:rw /dev/uinput
  This command adds rights to read/write /dev/uinput to user simmer.

Usage:

Step 1.
To build it, just run make... If error occurs, check prerequisities 
(bison, flex), and if something else is wrong, please file a bug.

Step 2.
Run program evtest to identify the device you want to use...
E.g.

> evtest
Available devices:
/dev/input/event12:	Jess Tech Dual Analog Rumble Pad

Use Ctrl+C to exit the program.

Step 3.
> ./evdevshift --device /dev/input/event12 --template dev.conf

This command creates the dev.conf template file, containing the available
keys and axes.

Step 4.
Customize the conf file.

See the test.conf file for some inspiration.

Steep 5.
Run the evdevshift with your new config.

>./evdevshift --config dev.conf

If all goes well, the new device should be visible and ready to use.

Please be carefull, this is very early release, so the checking is minimal - 
- if you instruct the program to do something stupid, it will do it...
Please report any problems you encounter with this program - only that way
you can ensure the problems will be fixed...
